# Contribution Requirements

Open source projects often require contributors to sign agreements before their submissions will be accepted.
These agreements are important to ensure contributions carry the correct licensing, but sometimes additional grants are requested.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

A [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) is a lightweight way for developers to license their contributions under the project's existing license or a compatible license.

The DCO does not contain any patent or copyright grants.
As such, the trademark owner of the project does not gain any special rights beyond the rights specified by the software license(s).


## Contributor License Agreement

A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is an agreement that contributors are required to sign before they may contribute to a software project.

A CLA is not inherently a problem, but some agreements require copyright grants and patent grants.
Centralization of rights to the project owner simplifies the license change process as contributors have delegated their rights.


## Informal or Non-existent Agreements

Smaller projects may accept contributions without formal agreement or sign-off from contributors.
Lack of licensing clarity can pose problems as contributors may not be the author, may not have rights to, or may not intend to license the code they have provided.
Should the author of a contribution later claim that their work is being used without proper license the project would need to drop the problematic contributions or seek legal support to decide how to proceed.
