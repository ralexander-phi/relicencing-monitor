# Open Source Pledge

A project can publish a pledge to stay open source indefinitely.
While pledges are non-binding and are occasionally broken, a pledge signals the project's current intent.


## Take the Always Open Pledge

To take the Always Open Pledge, complete and publish the following statement:

```
COMPANY NAME hereby pledges to release all future versions of
PROJECT NAME under an Open Source Initiative approved Open
Source license.
```

The pledge should be posted on an official website (non-personal) or in the project source code.
