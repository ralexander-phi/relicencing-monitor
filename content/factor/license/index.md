summary: How licensing impacts open source

# Licenses

## Permissive Licenses

*Examples: MIT License, BSD License, Public Domain*

Permissive licenses are popular as they grant many rights with few restrictions.
As such, projects licensed under these terms are easy for users to adopt.

Unfortunately, the broad openness of these licenses makes it possible for anyone to fork a permissively licensed project and release a derivative work under non-open source or commercial license terms.
When a company that owns the trademark of a project changes the license terms, it's often viewed as an undesired "rug-pull".
Thankfully, changes to license terms do not apply retroactively so community members can maintain their own forks of these projects.


## Copyleft Licenses

*Examples: GNU General Public License (GPL)*

A copyleft license requires that all derivative works grant the same rights by using a compatible copyleft license.
This added restriction makes copyleft licenses "less free" than permissive licenses.
However, copyleft licenses promote the health of the open source ecosystem by forbidding license changes that would reduce the permissions.
This ensures that derivative works remain open source.

Copyleft-licensed projects can still have their license changed if, for example, [contributors agree to copyright grants](http://localhost:1313/factor/agreements/).


## Non-open Source Licenses

*Examples: Server Side Public License, Commercial Licenses*

Always Open follows the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) (OSI) approved license list to determine if a license if open source.
Non-open source licenses may still grant users and developers broad rights, but they may contain terms that OSI does not consider to meet their definition of open source.
Several "open" licenses may be considered "fauxpen", or pretending to be open.
Always Open takes a conservative approach by labeling these as "non-open" and encourages readers to learn more about each license.


## Creative Commons Licenses

*Examples: Creative Commons BY-SA*

Many projects use Creative Commons licenses for project documentation.
These are technically not Open Source licenses as the Open Source Initiative hasn't approved them.
Approval is unlikely since these licenses aren't well suited for source code.
Since software projects are often combined works, containing both source code and documentation, Create Commons is often applicable.
